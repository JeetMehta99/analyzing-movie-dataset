### Project Overview

 This project aims to explore movie dataset and filter movies with high ratings. Now by filtering the movie with high ratings, the next task was to sugest these type of movies to a friend. So using Python I explored the ratings of the movies. There are movies in more than 50 languages but my friend wants to watch only English movies. Thus I was successfully able to analyze the date and sugget English movies with high ratings.


### Learnings from the project

 I learned the wide application of Python and how it can be used in our daily life. In this project what I learned more was how to efficiently filter out a particular thing which was more important.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I went step by step, function-by-function. This helped me reach my desired output earlier and a bit easier. 


### Challenges faced

 I faced a problem with  filtering out movies high ratings but was successfully able to overcome by taking some help from the internet and the revisiting the previous practices.


### Additional pointers

 None but providing a manual dataset done would've been better.
